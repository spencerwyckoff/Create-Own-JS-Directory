## Create Your Own JS Directory

# My JS Directory is tailored to running a T-Shirt business and the methods and formulas you would need to compute profit, costs, margin, %'s, selling #'s, rebuy #'s, etc.  

This was a fun exercise that solidified the power of Object Oriented Programming and how to go about creating our own directory of functions within an object.  It was eye-opening to see that most JavaScript libraries are just a bunch of custom built methods that make things easier than having to re-invent the wheel each time.  As a junior level developer, I'm very thankful for these libraries and am truly standing on the shoulders of giants.
